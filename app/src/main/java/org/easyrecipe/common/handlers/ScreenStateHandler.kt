/**
 * Handler for performing some actions depending on the screen state that is being currently
 * displayed in the fragment. It requires to have the fragment context in order to perform
 * some activity so it must be added to this class as soon as it is available, that is inside the
 * onCreateView of the fragment. In order to control the common states we can pass some functions
 * to the constructor. The default behaviour of [onLoading] is nothing and the one from
 * [onNoInternet] and [onOtherError] is showing a dialog. If the screen state is not any of the
 * common ones, then the [action] method is called with that state.
 *
 * @param T The states that are associated with the fragment
 * @property context The [Context] of the fragment
 * @property onLoading The [ScreenState.Loading] behaviour, being the default nothing
 * @property onNoInternet The [ScreenState.NoInternet] behaviour, being the default a dialog
 * @property onOtherError The [ScreenState.OtherError] behaviour, being the default a dialog
 * @property action The action that has to be performed depending of the [ScreenState]
