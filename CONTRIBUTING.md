# How to contribute

**Branch naming**

We are using a custom version of [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) methodology for naming the branches:
- feature: `feature/*`
- hotfix: `hotfix/*`
- documentation: `doc/*`
- asset: `asset/*`
- bug: `bug/*`

Moreover, the names of the branches have to be meaningful.

**Have you found a bug?**
1. Verify that the bug has not been reported yet by searching on [Issues](https://github.com/EasyRecipe/Easy-Recipe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).
2. If it does not exist, then [open a new issue](https://github.com/EasyRecipe/Easy-Recipe/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+Bug+title).

**Have you fixed a bug?**
